//! Realtime playback through the system audio device (cpal: CoreAudio, WASAPI, ALSA/Pulse/
//! PipeWire via ALSA, JACK, WebAudio).
//!
//! The UI thread owns a [`Player`]; the audio callback owns the [`MixEngine`] and a snapshot of
//! the session (`Arc<Session>`) that the UI swaps whenever the document changes. Commands go to
//! the callback through a channel; position and meters come back through atomics and a
//! `try_lock`ed snapshot, so the callback never blocks. When no device is available the player
//! falls back to a silent clock thread so the transport, meters and automation still run.
//!
//! Surround: the device is opened with as many output channels as it offers, up to the width of
//! the session's main format. Main channels (SMPTE/WAV order) go to device channels in order; when
//! the device has fewer channels than the main mix, the mix is folded down to stereo (ITU-R
//! BS.775) on the first two device channels.
//!
//! Plugins and threads: hosted third-party plugins (CLAP/VST3) are created, given their stored
//! state and prepared on the thread that calls [`Player::update_session`] (the UI thread), and
//! travel to the audio thread together with the session snapshot that needs them; the mix
//! engine adopts them (see `soundcraft_mix`'s crate docs). Instances the engine retires come back
//! on a return channel and are dropped on the UI thread ([`Player::idle`]). Plugin states for
//! saving are read on request ([`Player::capture_states`]: a command with a reply; the audio
//! thread answers between two blocks, never blocking). Plugin editors are driven on the UI thread
//! through handles taken from each instance before it leaves ([`Player::open_editor`]).
